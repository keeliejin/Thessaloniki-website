<p>We are a small, diverse pioneering team established in Thessaloniki in April 2016. For the first year and a half, we spent time focusing on ministering to God through prayer and worship, and partnering with already-established ministries in the city. It is through ministering to the heart of God that we are able to minister to others. In the fall of 2018, we felt God leading us to begin our own ministries out of the foundation of prayer and worship that we had been establishing. We have a heart to see the Kingdom of God come in power in the streets of Thessaloniki. Currently, we are leading a weekly Bible study and a monthly community night which includes worship, a message, and fellowship. In November 2018, we began the process of purchasing a space to use for offices, classroom, and kitchen. It was formerly used as a sex cinema, and needs a lot of work, both physically and spiritually. We are currently doing renovations and hope to have it functioning by the time we run our first DTS in September 2019.</p>
